                <h2>SECTION 1 - SHIPPING POLICY</h2>
                <p>
                    Please be advised that many items we carry exceed the 150lb standard shipping limit that is imposed by USPS, FedEx, and UPS. <b>This means we may need to use Freight Shipping to send your items, and unfortunately freight shipping adds on fees if they need to deliver to a residential address.</b> This is just a sad reality of shipping large, heavy (awesome) equipment. Please bear in mind the shipping costs are the responsibility of the customer. Any large item that is offered 'Free Shipping' will be sent to the closest Freight Terminal. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you live nearby and want to save some money, you can choose to pick up your order directly at our warehouse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to mitigate the risk of credit card fraud to both Rhino Adventure Gear and our customers, <b>we do not allow you to modify your shipping address after the order has been placed.</b> If we suspect a fraudulent transaction, we may contact you and conduct a brief security check. Please do not feel offended by this should it occur, we do it to insure that your accounts have not been compromised.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the unlikely event that your order is damaged during shipment, we will help you file a claim with the shipping company. After the order has left our warehouse, we are not responsible for any damages incurred and all claims of damages must be made directly with the shipping company. <b>Therefore we strongly suggest that you take the time to carefully inspect your purchase for damages BEFORE SIGNING the delivery paperwork.</b> 
                </p>

                <h3>INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING</h3>
                <p>
                    We are currently working on an international shipping solution, however do not offer international shipping at this time. <b>Due to the high risk nature of Fraud, we will not process orders with a shipping address of a third-party freight forwarder.</b> If you are an international customer, please email us at sales(at)rhinoadventuregear.com and we will reach out to you once we have an international shipping solution.
                </p>
                <h2>SECTION 2 - RETURN POLICY</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>To initiate a return, please email us at: info(at)rhinoadventuregear.com and we will advise you on how to proceed for the specific product you are returning. Do not put your return in the mail without contacting us first.  </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since returns are costly both for you and for us, we want to help you try to avoid them as much as possible.

                    <b>Please consider using a trackable shipping service and purchasing shipping insurance.</b> We don’t guarantee that we will receive your returned item.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We highly recommend you purchase insurance for your return shipment, and photograph the condition of the item prior to shipping, so that if it is damaged during return shipment, you can prove that the shipping company may be liable and collect the insurance claim, since we do not accept returns that arrive back at our warehouse damaged.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund. If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within a certain amount of days. If you haven’t received a refund yet, please check your bank account again and contact your credit card company, as it may take some time before your refund is officially posted. After checking with your bank and credit card company, if you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at info(at)rhinoadventuregear.com.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are always welcome to come return an item directly to our warehouse to avoid the return shipping fees and risk of damage to the product on its return journey. The 30-day return window and 10% restocking fee will still apply.
